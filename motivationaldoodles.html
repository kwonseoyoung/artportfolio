		    		<p>Microbes make up the majority of the Earth's living population. This is fortunately not to scale. That would be terrifying. Most are not harmful, but some can be, and many of those harmful ones can be found in drinking water. Support organizations in providing clean water to communities (SUCH AS FLINT MICHIGAN!), and continue to study and record scientific discoveries about these organisms!</p>

		    		<p> It‚Äôs okay to feel unsure about your gender identity, and it‚Äôs okay to not identity with the male <i>or</i> female gender. Understanding yourself takes time, and hopefully you are able to surround yourself in a community that supports how you express yourself. My support goes out to those who experience suppression from their families and communities and those who suffer from gender dysphoria. Please don‚Äôt lose hope, and remember that organizations like The Trevor Project are here to help you through your struggles. </p>

In our darkest times, they are a constant, reassuring force keeping us afloat, and they never fail to put smiles on our faces with their hijinks! So cuddle your pets! Feed them, play with them, &amp; love them! We often create the our best life experiences and memories with them! ‚ù§‚ù§</p>

Chip at it little by little, even if you can only do 5 minutes. Perseverance can guarantee eventual mastery of seemingly impossible skills. </p>

		    		<p> Self care is about taking care of your body, and exercise is part of that process! This doodle is dedicated to Cassey Ho, because she has been SUCH a strong role model in my positivity and exercise journey ‚ù§ and I wouldn't be where I am today without her support and motivation. This is one of Cassey's mantras that kept me going. #4YrswithBlogilates </p>

		    		<p> For those of us in the rainy mood, whether it's just because of exhaustion, stress, or bad things, remember to take a day to just put on some comfy clothes, turn on some music, and rest/relax. Sometimes calm moments in a corner can do wonders in clearing a mind. üòäüòä‚ù§‚ù§ (Exams are coming to an end soon, so hang in there!!)  </p>
